Yesterday you created a number of filter functions using the array given below
var cars = [
  { id: 1, year: 1997, make: 'Ford', model: 'E350', price: 3000 },
  { id: 2, year: 1999, make: 'Chevy', model: 'Venture', price: 4900 },
  { id: 3, year: 2000, make: 'Chevy', model: 'Venture', price: 5000 },
  { id: 4, year: 1996, make: 'Jeep', model: 'Grand Cherokee', price: 4799 },
  { id: 5, year: 2005, make: 'Volvo', model: 'V70', price: 44799 }
];
Use this array, with map and filter as outlined in the following

A new filtered array is created having only prices < than the value provided
This array is passed to the function implemented in the previous step, and the DOM is updated with this new table.
