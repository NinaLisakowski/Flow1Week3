<!--
a) Yesterday you used the array types map and join methods to create a UL with a number of names. 

Use this function+DOM manipulation to insert the UL somewhere in an HTML page.

b) Create a FORM with an input field + a submit button as sketched here.

Write the necessary code to add the new name to the array of names, and regenerate the <ul> with the updated list.

Hint: You will probably see, very shortly that the name is added, the screen flickers and it's gone again.
The problem is, that it submits to the server, so the full page is reloaded. 
To prevent this you can call .preventDefault() on the event argument which will prevent the default behaviour (submit) and it should work. 
You can also use preventDefault() to prevent a link from actually forwarding to the link-address.

c) Add two more buttons to the form with the text:  “remove first” and  “remove last”. Implement the behaviour inspired by how you solved part-b.
